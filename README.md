### üîç Overview

This project implements a basic optical network simulator.  
The main goal is to model a network topology, find all possible paths between nodes, propagate an optical signal, and evaluate key performance metrics such as:

- **Latency** (signal delay)
- **Noise accumulation**
- **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** in dB
